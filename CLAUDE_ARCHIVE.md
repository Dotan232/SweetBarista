# CLAUDE_ARCHIVE.md - Coffee Shop Sugar Drop Game Development History

*Archived: July 27, 2025*

This file contains the complete development history and detailed specifications for the Sweet Barista Coffee Shop Game project, developed through 11 focused sessions from January 22-28, 2025.

## Project Overview

A browser-based casual game where players control a barista's hand dropping sugar cubes into coffee cups moving on a conveyor belt. Features 15 progressively challenging levels with increasing conveyor speeds and complexity.

### Core Concept
- **Genre**: Casual arcade game
- **Platform**: Web browser (desktop and mobile)  
- **Target**: Quick 5-10 minute gameplay sessions
- **Monetization**: Google AdSense banner ads

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Game Engine**: Canvas API
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **No Backend**: All game logic client-side
- **No External Libraries**: Pure vanilla JavaScript

## Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay
1. Player controls a barista's hand at the top of the screen
2. Coffee cups move on a conveyor belt from right to left
3. Each cup displays required sugar cubes (1-3) on an order note
4. Player drops sugar cubes using Space (desktop) or tap (mobile)
5. Successfully fill all cup orders within time limit to complete level

### Physics & Timing
- Sugar cube drop time: ~1 second with realistic gravity
- Precise collision detection (exact cup boundaries)
- Missed cubes show splash animation on conveyor (0.3s fade)
- Hand animation when dropping

### Level Progression

## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
```
/src
  /game
    - Game.js (main game class)
    - Level.js (level management)
    - Hand.js (player control)
    - Cup.js (cup objects)
    - Sugar.js (sugar cube physics)
    - Conveyor.js (belt system)
  /ui
    - Timer.js
    - Score.js
    - Menu.js
  /utils
    - AssetLoader.js
    - AudioManager.js
    - CollisionDetection.js
    - InputHandler.js
  - main.js (entry point)
  - config.js (game settings)
```

### Best Practices
1. Use ES6 classes for game objects
2. Separate game logic from rendering
3. Implement proper game loop with fixed timestep
4. Handle edge cases (tab switching, window resize)
5. Add console debug mode for testing
6. Comment complex physics calculations

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] All 15 levels completable
- [ ] Touch controls work on mobile
- [ ] Audio can be muted/unmuted
- [ ] Game scales properly on all devices
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended play
- [ ] Proper error handling for failed asset loads
- [ ] Consistent 60 FPS performance

## Monetization Setup

### Google AdSense Integration
- Place ad containers outside game canvas
- Desktop: Two 728x90 banners (top/bottom)
- Mobile: One 320x50 banner
- Ensure ads don't interfere with gameplay
- Test with ad blockers (game should still work)

## Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

- Local storage for progress saving
- Additional mechanics (milk, chocolate)
- Endless mode
- Social sharing
- Achievements system

## Important Notes

1. **No user accounts**: Game resets on page refresh
2. **No backend**: Everything runs client-side
