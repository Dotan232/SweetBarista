# CLAUDE.md - Coffee Shop Sugar Drop Game

**üìã Archive Notice:** Complete development history and detailed specifications have been moved to `CLAUDE_ARCHIVE.md` (January 22-28, 2025 & August 6, 2025 development sessions). This file contains current working context and recent changes only.

## Project Overview

Browser-based casual game where players control a barista's hand dropping sugar cubes into coffee cups moving on a conveyor belt. Features 15 progressively challenging levels with increasing conveyor speeds and complexity.

### Core Concept
- **Genre**: Casual arcade game
- **Platform**: Web browser (desktop and mobile)
- **Target**: Quick 5-10 minute gameplay sessions
- **Monetization**: Google AdSense banner ads

### Session Management
- **Always read PLANNING.md** at the start of every new conversation
- **Check TASKS.md** before starting any work
- **Mark completed tasks** in TASKS.md immediately upon completion
- **Add newly discovered tasks** to TASKS.md when found during development

## SESSION START CHECKLIST
When this file is read, immediately:
1. Confirm you will use agents for ALL tasks in this session
2. List which agent handles which task type based on the workflow below
3. State: "Agent workflow active for this session"

## PRIORITY 1: MANDATORY PROCEDURES - ACTIVE SESSION PROTOCOL

‚ö†Ô∏è **YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS WORKFLOW FOR EVERY TASK IN THIS SESSION:**

### Agent Workflow Guidelines
For any change or addition to the game, always start by consulting **web-game-tech-architect agent** to assess technical feasibility and architectural impact, then engage the relevant specialist based on the nature of the change:
- Use **web-game-tech-architect** agent for core game mechanics, physics, canvas rendering, animations, input handling, performance optimization, bug fixing, or code architecture
- Use **game-polish-specialist** agent for visual effects, animations, audio integration, UI/UX improvements, mobile responsiveness, performance tuning, or final testing and deployment

**Golden rule:** No code reaches production without passing through both **web-game-tech-architect agent** for code quality and comprehensive validation.

**VIOLATION CHECK:** If you're about to write code without consulting agents, STOP.

### Visual Validation Protocol
‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY FOR ALL FRONT-END CHANGES:**

After implementing ANY front-end change (CSS, HTML, UI components), you MUST:

1. **Identify Changes Made**:
   - Document exactly what visual elements were modified
   - List affected files (styles.css, HTML structure, JS rendering)
   - Note expected visual impact

2. **Visual Validation Using Playwright MCP**:
   ```
   - Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8002 using mcp__playwright__browser_navigate
   - Take screenshot using mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot
   - Navigate through affected game states/screens
   - Capture additional screenshots of changed areas
   ```

3. **Design Compliance Review**:
   - Compare screenshots against `context/design_principles.md` standards
   - Verify color palette compliance (coffee shop theme)
   - Check typography hierarchy and readability
   - Validate touch target sizes (48px minimum mobile)
   - Confirm accessibility contrast ratios
   - Review responsive design across breakpoints

4. **Feature Validation**:
   - Test functionality of changed UI elements
   - Verify user interaction patterns work correctly
   - Check mobile touch responsiveness
   - Validate cross-platform compatibility

5. **Report Findings**:
   - Document any design principle violations found
   - Note successful implementations
   - Recommend fixes for any issues discovered

**CRITICAL RULE:** No front-end changes are considered complete without visual validation.

## PRIORITY 2: RESPONSE STYLE

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Game Engine**: Canvas API
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **No Backend**: All game logic client-side
- **No External Libraries**: Pure vanilla JavaScript

## Design Standards Reference

**All front-end development must comply with:**
- **Design Principles**: `context/design_principles.md` - Industry-standard visual guidelines
- **Color Palette**: Coffee shop theme with semantic color system
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (4.5:1 contrast minimum)
- **Mobile Standards**: 48px touch targets, responsive breakpoints at 768px/1024px
- **Performance**: 60fps target, <3s loading time
- **Typography**: Segoe UI font stack with defined hierarchy

**Quick Reference:**

## Recent Changes & Current Issues

### üéØ **Current Session (August 11, 2025 - Session 15)**

**Major Visual & Gameplay Fixes Completed:**
- ‚úÖ **Logo size optimization** - Increased logo size by 30% and repositioned for better visibility
- ‚úÖ **Start button simplification** - Changed button text from verbose instructions to simple "Start"
- ‚úÖ **Conveyor belt direction FIXED** - After 5 attempts, successfully implemented left-to-right movement matching cups
- ‚úÖ **Customer name tags implementation** - Used order_note_blank.png asset for professional order notes above cups
- ‚úÖ **Preview zone removal** - Eliminated transparent rectangle overlay for cleaner visual presentation
- ‚úÖ **Cup state persistence SOLVED** - Fixed critical bug where cups lost customer names and progress during wrap-around

**Critical Conveyor Belt Fix:**
- **Problem**: Belt moved right-to-left while cups moved left-to-right, or belt object physically translated causing gaps
- **Solution**: Reversed offset direction (`conveyorOffset -= speed`) with positive positioning (`startX = (offset % width)`) 
- **Result**: Belt texture animates left-to-right while staying in fixed position

**Cup Consistency System:**
- **Problem**: David, Mia, Alex would change names/requirements after wrap-around cycles
- **Root Cause**: `resetCup()` method was generating new orders after timer expiration
- **Solution**: Completely disabled cup resets during level gameplay - cups are now persistent for entire level
- **Result**: Fixed customer names and sugar requirements throughout all rotations

## Key Game Mechanics

### Level Progression Table
| Level | Time | Speed | Cups | Total Sugar | Difficulty |
|-------|------|-------|------|-------------|------------|
| 1     | 60s  | 1.0x  | 3    | 5-6         | Tutorial   |
| 5     | 60s  | 1.4x  | 7    | 13-14       | Medium     |
| 10    | 45s  | 1.9x  | 12   | 24-26       | Very Hard  |
| 15    | 35s  | 2.5x  | 17   | 39-42       | Master     |

### Core Gameplay
- **Fixed-position hand** at top center for timing-based gameplay
- **Circular conveyor system** with continuous cup cycling
- **Strategic cup filling** - Must fill ALL cups to exact requirements (1-3 sugar each)
- **Anti-spam mechanics** - Overfilling completed cups resets them to 0 sugar
- **Cup memory system** - Cups remember progress when wrapping around conveyor

### Mobile Optimizations
- **Mathematical positioning** - Fixed positions prevent cup overlapping: `[-200, -380, -560]`
- **Touch controls** - Drop button with haptic feedback, audio toggle buttons
- **Responsive UI** - Compact layout, proper touch targets (48px), zoom prevention
- **Platform detection** - Shows "Tap" vs "Press SPACE" instructions appropriately

## Responses

1. **Objective Feedback**: Always provide feedback that is based on verifiable facts and data. Avoid subjective opinions unless explicitly requested.

2. **Certainty in Agreement**: Only confirm that I am correct if you are 100% certain of the accuracy of the information. If you have any doubts, clearly express those doubts instead of agreeing to avoid misleading me.

3. **Clarification Requests**: If a statement is ambiguous or unclear, ask for clarification before providing feedback. This ensures that your response is based on accurate understanding.

4. **Examples for Clarity**: When providing feedback, include examples to illustrate your points. This helps in understanding the context and reasoning behind your feedback.

5. **Edge Cases**: If you encounter a situation where the information is incomplete or contradictory, outline the potential implications and suggest alternative perspectives or solutions. This will help in navigating complex scenarios effectively.
